Helpers for working with local utilities.

A local utility is a (persistent) utility registered in a local (persistent) site
manager. Local utilities need to be traversable and thus are usually children
of the local site manager itself.

    Our persistent sites are a mix of persistent and non-persistent
    bases, with many of them having multiple bases. For example (using
    the notation: name (bases,) [type])::

        example.com (GlobalSiteManager) [global]
        Application (GlobalSiteManager) [persistent]
        site-root.example.com (Application, example.com) [persistent]
        child.example.com (example.com) [global]
        site-child.example.com (child.example.com, site-root.example.com) [persistent]

    This gives site-child.example.com this (correct) resolution order::

        site-child.example.com, child.example.com, site-root.example.com
            Application, example.com, GSM

    However, :func:`zope.component.queryNextUtility` only looks in the *first* base to find
    a next utility. Therefore, when site-janux.ou.edu asks for a next utility,
    instead of getting something persistent from site-platform.ou.edu,
    it instead gets the global non-persistent version from platform.ou.edu.

    We don't generally want to change the resolution order, but we do need
    to tweak it here for getting next utilities so that we consider
    persistent things first. Note that this breaks down if we have
    utilities registered both persistently and non-persistently at the same level.

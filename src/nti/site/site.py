# newTransaction being called on the connection object at
# `transaction.begin` time, which in turn syncs the storage. However,
# when multi-databases are used, the other connections DO NOT get this
# called on them if they are implicitly loaded during the course of
# object traversal or even explicitly loaded by name turing an active
# transaction. This can lead to extra read conflict errors
# (particularly with RelStorage which explicitly polls for
# invalidations at sync time). (Once a multi-db connection has been
# used, then the next time it would be sync'd. A multi-db connection
# is associated with the same connection to another database for its
# lifetime, and when open()'d will sync all other such connections.
# Corrollary: ALWAYS go through a connection object to get access to
# multi databases; never go through the database object itself.)

# As a workaround, we iterate across all the databases and sync them manually; this increases the
# cost of handling transactions for things that do not use the other connections, but ensures
# we stay nicely in sync.

# JAM: 2012-09-03: With the database resharding, evaluating the need for this.

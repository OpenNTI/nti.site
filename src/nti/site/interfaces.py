        Runs the function given in `func` in a transaction and application local
        site manager (defaulting to the current site manager).

        :param function func: A function of zero parameters to run. If
            it has a docstring, that will be used as the transactions
            note. A transaction will be begun before this function
            executes, and committed after the function completes. This
            function may be rerun if retries are requested, so it
            should be prepared for that.

            transaction and execution of `func` if
            :class:`transaction.interfaces.TransientError` is raised
            when committing. Defaults to zero (so the job runs once).

            number of retries will be used.

            this function will sleep for this long between retry
            attempts.

            virtual host names to use. If you do not provide this argument,
            then the currently installed site will be maintained when
            the transaction is run. NOTE: The implementation of this
            may maintain either the site names or the actual site
            object.

        :keyword bool side_effect_free: If true (not the default), then
            the function is assummed to have no side effects that need
            to be committed; the transaction runner is free to abort/rollback
            or commit the transaction at its leisure.

            root of the ZODB that will serve as the starting point to look for the

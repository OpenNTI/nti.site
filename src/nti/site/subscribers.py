    Set the current ``zope.component.hooks`` site to the ``new_site``
    object found during traversal, being careful to maintain any
    previously installed host (site-name) configurations as lower
    priority than the new site.

    Sites encountered during traversal are expected to have the main
    application site (e.g., ``nti.dataserver``) in their base chain so
    we have access to its configuration and persistent utilities. This
    implies that sites encountered during traversal are either
    synthetic (generated by a traversal adapter to use some particular
    ``IComponents``) or themselves persistent.

    Because of this, when we encounter the root or dataserver folders
    as sites, we take no action (unless there is no site presently
    installed; in that case we install them).

    We expect that something else takes care of clearing the site.

    .. important::

        Clearing the site is important, especially if the site was persistent.
        You can use a subscriber to "end request" style events or otherwise
        make it part of request lifecycle. When that's not possible, please do
        so manually.
